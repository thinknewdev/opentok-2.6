# cordova-plugin-opentok-v2.6.0
Cordova Plugin for OpenTok - add webrtc video to your iOS or Android App using latest OpenTok SDK v2.6.0

I have been using https://github.com/songz/cordova-plugin-opentok for my cordova app. It has not been updated with the latest OpenTok SDK v2.6.0

So, I have just duplicate the code and added new SDKs.

Installation: cordova plugin add https://github.com/prabinyovan/cordova-plugin-opentok-v2.6.0
